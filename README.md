This is the README file for the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

The problem statement of the project is included in the comments of the solution script "run_analysis.R"

To create the tidy data as described in:
http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf

the only script needed to be run is:

run_analysis.R

The information of the features in the data set and the source is included in CodeBook.md

An area to improve the script for the future is the implementation of the aggregation using the plyr package 
rather than the aggregate command which was clunky.
